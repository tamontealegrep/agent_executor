"""Session resolver — decides new / continuing / stale BEFORE the graph is invoked.

Lives outside the LangGraph graph on purpose (DESIGN_PATTERNS.md P03): the
caller has to decide which of `invoke(fresh_state, config)` or
`invoke(Command(resume=...), config)` to use before the graph can even be
called, and a graph node only ever runs after that decision has already
been made. `graph.get_state(config)` doubles as the session store: an
empty `.values` means no checkpoint exists yet for this thread_id (brand
new).

    Parameters:

            `None`/empty for a thread_id with no checkpoint yet.
        timeout_minutes (float | None): `None` means a session never goes stale.
        now (datetime | None): Injected for deterministic tests; defaults to
            the real current UTC time. Staleness must be measured against
            the moment the reply actually arrived, not against when the
            question was asked — callers resolve staleness AFTER waiting
            for the reply, not before.

    Returns:
        SessionResolution: `"new"` when no checkpoint exists yet for this
            session key; `"stale"` when `timeout_minutes` is set and more
            time than that has elapsed since `last_message_at`;
