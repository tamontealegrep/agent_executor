"""Bundles everything `runtime/` needs into one self-contained, file-shaped artifact.

This is the answer to "can the compiled graph be a replaceable file in my
backend?" — yes, specifically this one. `RuntimeArtifact.to_dict()` is a
plain, JSON-serializable dict with zero Pydantic objects and zero
`langgraph` types; `runtime_artifact_from_dict()` reconstructs it. A
backend that only ever *runs* compiled agents needs:

- `runtime/*.py` (the LangGraph-executing engine)
- `targets/langgraph/{condition_parser,type_parser,graph_renderer,runtime_artifact}.py`
  (dataclass definitions + this loader — none of them touch disk or import
  `langgraph`/`openai`)
- `dsl/schemas.py` + `dsl/utils.py` (just the Pydantic models the artifact's
  `tool_contracts` are typed with, and the GO_TO regexes — no YAML I/O)

It does NOT need `dsl/loaders.py`, `dsl/validators.py`, `dsl/classifier.py`,
`dsl/deduplicator.py`, `targets/text/`, `diagrams/`, `compiler.py`, or
`cli.py` — none of that is "the engine," it's "the compiler," and the
compiler's job ends the moment `artifact.json` is written. Swapping an
agent in production means replacing that one file and reloading it —
never touching or redeploying the engine code.

# Which `policies.yaml` sections reach which LangGraph LLM call sites
# (2026-09-18). `policies.yaml` itself is never carried into the
# `RuntimeArtifact` — only two pre-filtered, flattened line lists
# (`say_policies`/`judgment_policies`) are. This keeps
# `runtime/graph_builder.py` "dumb": it interpolates whatever text it is
# given, with zero knowledge of policy section names or channels.
#
# The split is by call *purpose*, not by node type: `say_sections` reach
# every call that generates text the user actually reads (`render_say`,
# for `message`/`terminal`/`question` phrasing and the global router's
# matched-handler/FAQ `say`). `judgment_sections` reach every call that
# interprets or decides something without saying it
# (`_llm_extract_capture`, `_apply_conditional_mutations`,
# `_llm_compute_store_value`, `_llm_pick_condition`, `_llm_bind_tool_inputs`
# — see `LLMContext.policies` in `runtime/llm_client.py`, which is how the
# judgment side actually reaches each call without a parameter threaded
# through all five).
#
# Section *names* are channel-specific (`style_and_async_rules` vs.
# `style_and_vui_rules` vs. `style_rules` — three different real names for
# "tone", one per `profiles/channels/*.yaml`; confirmed by reading all
# three files, not assumed), so a flat, channel-agnostic list silently
# drops tone/length/format for every channel but the one whose section
# names happen to match. `POLICY_SECTIONS_BY_CHANNEL` fixes that: one
# `ChannelPolicyMapping` per channel *profile name* (not per `ChannelType`
# — several profiles could in principle share the same coarse
# `ChannelType`, but each profile is its own independent set of section
# names), keyed the same way `compile_agent`/`load_channel_profile`
# already key a profile — its filename stem under `profiles/channels/`.
#
# Adding a new channel profile is one new dict entry here, nothing else —
# `_policy_mapping_for_channel` below refuses to silently fall through for
# an unmapped one (see its docstring) instead of quietly returning less
# content than the caller expects, the same failure mode a flat list had
# for every channel but `async_text`.
