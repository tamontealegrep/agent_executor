"""
Knowledge bases an agent can answer open questions from.

    The agent's strict flow answers closed questions from FAQs (fixed, exact text). A
    knowledge base covers the rest: open questions that need the company's own
    information (which services exist, who they are for, how they work).

    Two implementations share one contract, `KnowledgeBase.retrieve`:

    - `MarkdownKnowledgeBase`: one Markdown document, returned whole on every call. Right for
      a small, stable document (a services description of a few pages). The document leads the
      prompt (see `build_answer_prompt`) so the provider's prompt cache can reuse it.
    - `RAGKnowledgeBase`: the base of a retrieval-backed store (vector or keyword search). It
      returns only the few passages that match the question. Subclasses supply `_search`.

    `answer_from_knowledge` is the one place that turns retrieved passages into a reply, so
    swapping the Markdown document for a retrieval store changes nothing else.
